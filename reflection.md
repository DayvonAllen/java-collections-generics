## Reflection
- Reflection is a programming language's ability to inspect and dynamically call methods, classes etc.
- So we can inspect the source code dynamically at run-time
- because of object-oriented design(polymorphism) we may not know the classes and methods at compile time
- We can get classes with the `getClass()` method.
- reflection is important since it lets you write programs that do not have to know everything at compile time
- such as inheritance relationships
- This is how we can make dynamic programs as the classes and methods may be tied together at run-time
- Several frameworks use reflection - Junit and Spring
- For example Junit looks for methods with the `@Test` annotations
- The framework will call these methods when we run tests.
