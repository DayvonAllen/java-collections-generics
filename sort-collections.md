## Sorting In Java
- Java uses `QuickSort` to sort primitive types(int, float etc.)
  - This sort can have a time complexity of O(n^2) but has the fasted average time complexity of any sort algo.
- Java uses `MergeSort` to sort reference types(Integer, String)
  - Guaranteed time complexity of O(n log(n))
